# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to test different ideas or things about angular. As I am fairly new to angular I might have different queries that might be better to test out myself, so I'll combine all the tests and push them to this repo.


# Future ideas to test out
- When does a component's constructor, ngOnInit and ngOnDestroy called, and when does it's child's constructor, ngOnInit or ngOnDestroy called. 
- Is angular services shared across components? I mean do they instantiate once and then shared between components or do they instantiate on every component call?
- Configure tailwind with angular.
- Configure css post processing (remove unused css classes from stylesheet) with angular.
